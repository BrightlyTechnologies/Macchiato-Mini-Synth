# Macchiato-Mini-Synth
Mini Synth setup files, software sketches, executables, code development, new releases

The Macchiato Mini Synth by Zeppelin Design Labs is a nifty digital synthesizer that fits in the palm of your hand. The control software was developed in the Arduino environment, incorporating the Mozzi Sound Synthesis library by Tim Barrass. The software runs on an AtMega 644PA microcontroller.

On this GitHub page, you can modify the original source code and propose changes to the Macchiato software. We may from time to time release updated and improved versions of the original software, or alternate versions with completely different functions and sounds. To successfully edit and compile the code in Arduino (the sketch files, ending in .ino), you will need to perform some considerable setup first, which we will cover in detail later. On the other hand, you can just download new releases (the binary, or hex files, ending with .cpp.hex) and flash them to your Macchiato. This is pretty easy.
